# Adaptive Cards JSON for design work

These JSON files assist our UI revamp effort. The files themselves are not supported nor they represent any supported scenarios.

To preview the file, copy and paste them to [Adaptive Cards Visualizer](http://adaptivecards.io/visualizer/). Or use the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomlm.vscode-adaptivecards).
